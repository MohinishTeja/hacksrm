# SlackDown
#Team-  Sole Survivors


Project Name--    SlackDown.

  Slack provides every workspace with a capacity of 10k messages for free. Further our messages will be deleted automatically if we don't upgrade to paid version.Hence, we would like to use the JSON dump files provided by slack to recreate a interface that has all the old messages displayed in it. Further, we will be adding search option and Analytics to show the progress and trends happening in the workspace.
  
  
  As we said above our SLACKDOWN will help us see all the old messages that we will be loosing from slack after 10k messages.Further, it will be saving like 3$ per user each month. If we take a workspace of 100 members then we will be saving like 300$ each month.
  
  Slack JSON data is originally used to merge two workspaces but here we will be using it to recreate the entire conversation.This is a unique kind of project.
  
  
  Tools/technologies we use - JavaScript,JS libraries,HTML,CSS.
